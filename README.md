# ecs.pipeline
This AWS CloudFormation template defines a pipeline for deploying applications using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and ECS.
Parameters
Environment: The type of environment (e.g., Sandbox, prod, qa, dev).
ProjectName: The name of the pipeline project.
PipelineRepository: The name of the CodeCommit repository containing the Dockerfile and other build information.
VpcId: The ID of the VPC where resources will be deployed.
Owner: The name of the owner.
ECSClusterName: The name of the ECS cluster.
ECSServiceName: The name of the service inside the ECS cluster.
RepoURI: The URI of the ECR repository.
ECRName: The name of the ECR repository.
BuildName: The name of the CodeBuild project.
ContainerName: The name of the container in the task definition.
FileName: The name of the ECS file (default: imagedefinitions.json).
Resources
S3 Buckets for Cache and Artifacts

S3Cache: A private S3 bucket for storing build cache.
S3Artefact: A private S3 bucket for storing build artifacts.
IAM Roles

CodePipelineRole: An IAM role with permissions for CodePipeline.
CodeBuildRole: An IAM role with permissions for CodeBuild.
CodeBuild Project

CodeBuild: Defines a CodeBuild project that pulls the source code from CodeCommit, builds the Docker image, and pushes it to ECR. It uses the environment variables provided to configure the build environment.
CodePipeline

CodePipeline: Defines a CodePipeline with three stages: Source, Build, and Deploy.
Source Stage: Pulls the source code from the specified CodeCommit repository.
Build Stage: Uses CodeBuild to build the Docker image.
Deploy Stage: Deploys the built Docker image to the specified ECS service using ECS provider.
Metadata
AWS::CloudFormation::Interface: Groups parameters into sections for better organization in the AWS Management Console.
Key Properties and Attributes
S3 Buckets: Configured with private access and public access blocks.
IAM Roles: Configured with policies that allow the necessary permissions for CodePipeline and CodeBuild to execute.
CodeBuild Environment: Configured with environment variables and privileges for Docker.
Pipeline Stages:
Source Stage: Monitors the specified CodeCommit repository.
Build Stage: Executes the build process using the specified CodeBuild project.
Deploy Stage: Updates the ECS service with the new image definition file.
This template sets up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the process of fetching code, building a Docker image, and deploying it to an ECS service, providing a complete workflow for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
